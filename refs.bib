This is resulting in undesirable conditions such as recirculation or mixing of hot and cool air, poorly controlled humidity and costly wasted cooling capacity. This paper will define; cooling oversupply, provide examples for quantifying cool air bypass and hot air recirculation, and assign principles to evaluate high-density rack performance and cooling efficiency benefits which are gained from Unity CoolingTM - the raising of supply air temperature and supplying only the cooling required by the IT load.},

abstract = {Data centres are large energy consumers today, and their consumption is expected to increase further, driven by the growth in cloud services. The large monetary cost and the environmental impact of this consumption have motivated operators to optimize data centre management. We argue that one of the underlying reasons for the low-energy utilization is the lack of visibility into a data centre's highly dynamic operating conditions. Wireless sensor networks promise to remove this veil of uncertainty by delivering large volumes of data collected at high spatial and temporal fidelities. The paper summarizes data centre operations in order to describe the parameters that a data centre sensing network should collect and motivate the challenges that such a network faces. We present technical approaches for the problems of data collection and management and close with an overview of a data centre genome, an end-to-end data centre sensing system.},
